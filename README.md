The vanilla enchantment system is pretty bad, huh... 
Currentky the system is filled with manditory stat increases like looting, sharpness, efficency and protection, and anoying must-haves like mending, unbreaking & fortune - it's nightmare!

"Dash Me If You Can" seeks to overhaul enchanting by abolishing, disintegrating and removing the current set of enchantments and adding 2-3 fleashed out enchantments that unlock different abilitys for your weapons/tools/armor - From bashing with a shield, using an end crystal as a tenis ball too Shooting a concentrated of frost and ice and so, so much more.

Oh yeah, the enchantments added try to make PvP/PvE feel like a combat shooter (double jumps, dashes and generally lots of movement)
